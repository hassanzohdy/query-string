description: Package orientation for @mongez/query-string — what it does, how to import it, its mental model, environment constraints, and scope boundaries vs. sibling packages.
when_to_use: User imports queryString from "@mongez/query-string" for the first time, user asks what the package does or how it works, user is unsure which @mongez package handles URL query strings, user needs to understand browser vs. server constraints for the package.

# Overview

`@mongez/query-string` is the parse/serialize half of every URL-driven feature — filters, sorts, pagination, search forms — packaged as one default-export object. Pass it an object, get back a query string with `[]` array brackets and `[parent][child]` nesting. Pass it a query string, get back an object with numeric coercion applied.

Four browser-bound methods (`all`, `get`, `update`, `toString`) read and write `window.location`. The two pure data methods (`parse`, `toQueryString`) work anywhere.

No runtime dependencies.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @mongez/query-string
```

## Import pattern

```ts
import queryString from "@mongez/query-string";

queryString.parse(text);
queryString.toQueryString(obj);

// browser-only:
queryString.all();
queryString.get(key, fallback);
queryString.toString();
queryString.update(params);
```

There are no named exports for the public API. The internal `toObjectParser` / `toStringParser` are reachable for callers that want to bypass the facade, but they're implementation details.

## Mental model

| Concept | Type | Mental model |
|---|---|---|
| `parse` / `toQueryString` | pure function | Stateless conversion between `Record<string, any>` and `string`. Same in browser and server. |
| `all` / `get` / `toString` | browser read | Sugar over `parse(window.location.search)`. |
| `update` | browser write | Sugar over `history.replaceState(pathname + "?" + toQueryString(params))`. |
| Numeric coercion | parse-time | Values matching `!isNaN(v - parseFloat(v))` become numbers. Lossy by design: `"007"` → `7`. |
| Array shape | URL convention | `key[]=a&key[]=b` ⇄ `{ key: ["a", "b"] }`. |
| Object shape | URL convention | `parent[child]=v` ⇄ `{ parent: { child: v } }`. Any depth. |

## Environment

- **Browser**: every method works.
- **Server / Worker**: `parse` and `toQueryString` are safe. `all` / `get` / `toString` / `update` reference `window.location` / `window.history` and will throw. Guard with `typeof window !== "undefined"` if the same module loads on both sides, or call from a client-only effect.

## Scope boundaries

| Concern | Lives in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| URL / path joining, normalization | `@mongez/concat-route` | Different concern from query-string |
| React-aware URL state hooks | `@mongez/react-router` | This package is framework-agnostic |
| Cookies / localStorage / sessionStorage | `@mongez/cache` | Different storage |
| Form state | `@mongez/react-form` | Different concern |

## Idioms

- **Call `update` from event handlers, not effects.** It's a deliberate side effect on browser history; running it in a `useEffect` makes the URL flip on every render. If you must, debounce or compare against `queryString.toString()` first.
- **Don't trust `get(key, default)` for falsy values.** `all[key] || default` falls through for `0`, `""`, `false`. Use `key in queryString.all()` if you need a presence check.
- **Pre-encode values with `encodeURIComponent`** if they may contain `&`, `=`, `?`, or non-ASCII characters. The serializer does NOT encode for you.
- **Use `update({})` to clear the query string.** It rewrites the URL to just the pathname.
- **`update` does not fire `popstate`.** If you mirror URL state into another store, subscribe to your store, not `popstate`.
